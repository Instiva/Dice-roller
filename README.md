# Dice-roller
Dice rolling simulator 

This program is intended to set a number of dice, the number of sides on each dice, then perform a fair roll is performed for each one and sum the values rolled. 
The endgoal for this bit of code is to produce a module that goes into a larger code that produces a visualization to demonstrate the likelihood of the rolling the given sum, the individual sequence, and more. 
Eventually, an implementation using a hardware system (such as Raspberry Pi GPIO or Arduino) that allows for physical interaction and visualizaton will be created. Creating and using this program is intended as a learning exercise.
